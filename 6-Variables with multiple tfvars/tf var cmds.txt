## formatting a tf file

terraform fmt

## cmd line vars

terrafor plan/apply -var="instancetype=t2.micro"


## passing tf variables via file 

create a file with "parameter/variable=value" and name it ".auto.tfvars" which is different from the "variable.tf" file
    ........run terraform plan -var-file=".auto.tfvars"(if adhoc change is required via terminal)........


## passing vars via env variables

export TF_VAR_instancetype=t2.micro   &   to check if it was done successfully, use echo $TF_VAR_instancetype  OR type "env" to see all the env variables.

and to undo this: unset TF_VAR_instancetype



###how to run tf when there are "muliple .tfvars" files in a folder(which represent diff environments eg dev, prod, test)

1) create workspaces in addition to the default terraform workspace depending on the number of .tfvars files
  a. run "terraform workspace" to see the various subcommands like "delete, new, select show, list" 
  b. e.g run terraform workspace new test (this is to create and automatically shift to the newly created workspace named test) 
  c. Also run terraform workspace new dev (this is to create and automatically shift to the newly created workspace named dev)
  d. to then list workspaces use "terraform workspace list test,dev...etc"  and use "terraform workspace select test,dev...." to select the desired workspace


2) terraform plan/apply --var-file=variables/dev.tfvars. (this is bc tf can't read folders so we have to explicitly pass the intended file pass)
